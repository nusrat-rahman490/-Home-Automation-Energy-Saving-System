# Home Automation & Energy-Saving System

## Overview
This Arduino-based project automates home lighting to save energy.  
It uses a **PIR sensor** to detect motion and controls an **LED** (light).  
The system turns lights ON when motion is detected and OFF after inactivity.

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- PIR Sensor
- LED (or Relay for appliances)
- Resistors & Jumper Wires

## Features
- Motion detection using PIR sensor
- Automatic energy-saving light control
- Simple, cost-effective, and scalable

## Skills
- Sensors
- Microcontroller programming (Arduino)
- Hardware-software integration



## Future Improvements
- Add relay module to control actual appliances.
- Integrate with IoT for remote monitoring.
